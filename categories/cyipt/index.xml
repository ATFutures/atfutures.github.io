      <description>The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) The Active Transport Toolkit builds on our expertise developing the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT). This is an online, interactive mapping tool to help decide where to prioritise new cycling infrastructure (Lovelace et al. 2017). It&amp;rsquo;s publicly accessible at pct.bike where you can test out it&amp;rsquo;s functionality by clicking on a region.
The PCT is being used by dozens of local authorities across England to develop strategic cycling networks.</description>

 Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) portal showing the relationship between deaths from road traffic casualties and air polution in France and Ghana.</description>
