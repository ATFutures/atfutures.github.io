      <description>Active Transport Futures Software is used by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of their Urban Health Initiative. An important focus for the WHO is understanding how, when, where, and why people move throughout cities. We are currently developing a prototype tool to aid the cities of Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal, to effectively plan active transport futures. Examples of our tool in action can be seen in this interactive map of &amp;lsquo;first mile&amp;rsquo; pedestrian flows from towards bus stops, and the equivalent &amp;lsquo;last mile&amp;rsquo; flows from bus stops.</description>
