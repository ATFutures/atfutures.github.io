      <description>Active Transport Futures Software is used by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of their Urban Health Initiative. An important focus for the WHO is understanding how, when, where, and why people move throughout cities. We are currently developing a prototype tool to aid the cities of Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal, to effectively plan active transport futures.
The tool is currently a prototype development platform only, and is intended to demonstrate the technical feasibility of interactive viewing of multiple layers representing aggregate movements throughout a city for different purposes and using different modes of active transport (currently walking and cycling).</description>
