      <description>Our primary software tools are developed as modular R packages, including:
 osmdata, a package for very efficient and flexible extraction of data from Open Street Map (OSM). dodgr (Distances on Directed Graphs in R), a package for highly efficient and scalable routing and allocation of aggregate flows on complex, dual-weighted graphs.  </description>

      <description>Active Travel Futures develops and provides globally scalable software to aid cities to plan futures in which active travel such as walking and cycling play increasingly prominent roles. Our tools use open sources of data with global coverage and aim to be globally applicable independent of the availability of local data.
This work is currently being developed in conjunction with the World Health Organization, for which we are developing a prototype tool to aid planning active travel futures in Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal.</description>
