      <description>Our primary software tools are developed as modular R packages, including:
 osmdata, a package for very efficient and flexible extraction of data from Open Street Map (OSM). For a description of the package and its functionality, see the vignette. In short, osmdata allows street networks for entire cities to be downloaded and analysed in a few short lines of code and within a few seconds. dodgr (Distances on Directed Graphs in R), a package for highly efficient and scalable routing and allocation of aggregate flows on complex, dual-weighted graphs.</description>

      <description>We are currently developing a prototype tool for the World Health Organization to aid the cities of Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal, to effectively plan active transport futures. The project is developed as an entirely open and repeatable github repository, with the initial report available here.</description>

      <description>ATFutures and the New Urban Agenda The aims of Active Transport Futures reflect and strive to meet the following paragraphs from the New Urban Agenda document produced from the United Nations Habitat III Conference (Quito, Ecuador, 20 Oct 2016). Highlighting is ours, used to emphasis our particular agenda.
Paragraph #113 &amp;lsquo;We will take measures to improve road safety and integrate it into sustainable mobility and transport infrastructure planning and design.</description>

      <description>Active Transport Futures develops and provides globally scalable software to aid cities to plan futures in which active transport such as walking and cycling play increasingly prominent roles. Our tools use open sources of data with global coverage and aim to be globally applicable independent of the availability of local data.
This work is currently being developed in conjunction with the World Health Organization, for which we are developing a prototype tool to aid planning active transport futures in Accra, Ghana, and Kathmandu, Nepal.</description>
